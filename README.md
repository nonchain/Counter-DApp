## Introduction

This project is a Decentralized Application (DApp) developed using Solidity, Next.js, TypeScript, and the Thirdweb framework. It combines the power of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain with a modern web application for a seamless decentralized experience.

### Features

- **Solidity Smart Contract**: A Solidity smart contract is used to handle the core logic of the application. It can manage data, process transactions, and enforce rules on the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Next.js Frontend**: The front-end of the DApp is built using Next.js, a popular React framework. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the smart contract.

- **TypeScript**: The entire project is written in TypeScript, providing type safety and improved code quality.

- **Thirdweb Framework**: The Thirdweb framework simplifies the deployment and connection of your smart contract to the front-end, making it easier to build decentralized applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: You need Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- Ethereum Wallet: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you'll need an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and some test Ether for development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-dapp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-dapp
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server, allowing you to access the DApp in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to your test network.

3. Interact with the DApp through the user interface to perform actions on the smart contract.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity and you can connect your own smart contract to the front-end

Just change *CLIENT_ID* and the *CONTRACT_ADDRESS*.
